/// Types for the collab protocol.
/// 
/// The collab protocol is relatively simple. The collab server can open and close files. Each open
/// file has a corresponding collaboration session, to/from which clients can add/remove themselves
/// as participant. When a client requests to open a file, it really requests to be added as a
/// participant to (the collaboration session of) that file. Similarly, when a client requests to
/// close a file, it really requests to be removed as a participant from (the collaboration session)
/// of that file. Files are only opened/closed as necessary, that is, when the first client is added
/// or the last client removed as a participant.
/// 
/// Once the client is a participant for a file, it can request to apply deltas to that file. Deltas
/// are always applied to a given revision of a file. Because of network latency, different clients
/// clients may have different revisions of the same file. The server maintains a linear history of
/// all deltas from the oldest revision to the newest revision. Whenever a delta for an older
/// revision comes in, it is transformed against these older revisions so it can be applied to the
/// newest revision. Only when all clients have confirmed that they have seen a revision (by sending
/// a delta based on that revision) will the server remove that delta from its history.
/// 
/// Whenever a server applies a delta to a file, it notifies all the participants of that file
/// except the one from which the request to apply the delta originated of this fact. This allows
/// the participants to update their revision of the file accordingly.
