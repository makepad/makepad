# makepad-example-simple

A very simple example of a Makepad Framework application, used to illustrate the basic concepts of Makepad Framework. For an explanation of what Makepad Framework is, please see the README for the [makepad-widgets](https://crates.io/crates/makepad-widgets) crate.

The example consists of a chromeless window containing both a button and a label displaying a counter. Clicking the buttnon will increment the counter. It illustrates the basics of initializing an application,  handling events, drawing the UI, and working with the DSL.

The code for this example is fairly well commented, so it should be a good starting point for playing around with Makepad Framework.
