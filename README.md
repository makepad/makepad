# Introducing Makepad

Makepad is a new VR, web and native collaborative shader programming environment. 
It will support many different shader modes including many vertex-shaders 
besides the well known shader toy SDF programs. This makes shader coding possible
for more compute constrained environments like VR goggles or mobiles.
Try makepad now on a Quest in the quest browser, click the goggles top right of the UI. Try touching the leaves of the tree with your hands! Magic!

The Makepad development platform and library ecosystem are MIT licensed,
for the Quest and in the future iOS we will provide paid, native version

# How to install the native version

On all platforms first install Rust. We have seen the gnu chain fail a lot on windows, so if you are up for it also have to install msvc.

https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

# MacOS

```
git clone https://github.com/makepad/makepad
cd makepad
tools/macos_rustup.sh
cargo run -p makepad --release
```

# Windows

Clone this repo using either gitub desktop or commandline: https://github.com/makepad/makepad
Open a cmd.exe in the directory you just cloned. Gh desktop makes: Documents\\Github\\makepad

Gnu chain (can fail):
```
rustup default stable-gnu
tools/windows_rustup.bat
cargo run -p makepad --release
```

MSVC chain (install msvc first):
```
rustup default stable-msvc
tools/windows_rustup.bat
cargo run -p makepad --release
```

# Linux
```
git clone https://github.com/makepad/makepad
cd makepad
tools/linux_rustup.sh
cargo run -p makepad --release
```

# Troubleshooting
```
Delete old settings unix: rm *.ron
Delete old settings windows: del *.ron
Make sure you are on master: git checkout master
Update rust: rustup update
Make sure you have wasm: rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
Pull the latest: git pull
```
