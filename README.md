# Makepad

## Overview

This is the repository for Makepad, a new way to build UIs in Rust for both native and the web.

Makepad consists of two parts: Makepad Framework and Makepad Studio.

*Makepad Framework* is our UI framework. It still has some rough edges and missing features, but it's already possible to build real apps with it. It consists of multiple crates, but the top level crate is [makepad-widgets](https://crates.io/crates/makepad-widgets).

Here are some links to demo apps that we've built with Makepad Framework:
[makepad-example-simple](https://makepad.nl/makepad/examples/simple/src/index.html)
[makepad-example-ironfish](https://makepad.nl/makepad/examples/ironfish/src/index.html)

*Makepad Studio* is a prototype of an IDE that we've built using Makepad Framework. It's already usable, but still needs some love before it's ready for prime-time. The main crate for Makepad Studio is [makepad-studio](https://crates.io/crates/makepad-studio).

### Prerequisites

To build the Makepad crates you first need to install Rust.
[https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

Our native builds work on the stable Rust toolchain. However, some of the errors generated by Makepad at runtime (particulary those originating in our DSL) do not contain line information unless you use the nightly Rust toolchain. Moreover, our web builds only work on nightly for now. For this reason, we recommend that you build Makepad using the nightly Rust toolchain.

For the non standard build targets (apple ios, apple tvos, android, wasm) we have a buildtool called 'cargo-makepad' that you need to install.

Install it from the repo:

```cargo install --path=./tools/cargo_makepad```

Now this tool can be used to install the toolchains you need for each platform:

```cargo makepad wasm install-toolchain```
```cargo makepad apple ios install-toolchain```
```cargo makepad apple tvos install-toolchain```
```cargo makepad android --abi=all install-toolchain```

## Running Makepad Studio

Makepad Studio allows you to easily build and view the examples. It uses cargo-makepad internally, so be sure to install cargo-makepad as shown above.

```cargo run -p makepad-studio --release```

Or install it from cargo (might be behind the repo)

```cargo install makepad-studio```

If you build the wasm applications, you can open it on:
