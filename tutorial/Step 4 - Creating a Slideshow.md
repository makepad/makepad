In the previous two steps, we built an image grid. Image grids allow you to view multiple images at the same time. Sometimes, however, instead of viewing multiple images at the same time, you want to view multiple images one at a time. That's what slideshows are for.

In this step, we're going to create a simple slideshow for our app. Our slideshow will have the following features:
- It will display a single image at full size.
- It will have two buttons on each side, used for navigating it by mouse.
- It will be navigable by keyboard.

At the end of this step, you will have a working implementation of a slideshow.
## What you will learn
In this step, you will learn:
- How inheritance works in Makepad.
- How key focus works in Makepad.
## Adding Arrow Icons
For the two buttons, we need some arrow icons, so let's start by adding those as resources to our app.

Navigate to the `resources` directory, and then download the following files to it:
[[left_arrow.svg]]
[[right_arrow.svg]]

We'll be using these file as our arrow icons.
## Updating the DSL Code
Now that we've added the arrow icons, let's update the DSL code with the definitions we need.
### Defining Variables
Add the following code to the call to the `live_design` macro in `app.rs`:
```
    LEFT_ARROW = dep("crate://self/resources/left_arrow.svg");
    RIGHT_ARROW = dep("crate://self/resources/right_arrow.svg");
```

This code defines variables named `LEFT_ARROW` and `RIGHT_ARROW` to refer to the arrow icons that we added to the `resource` directory earlier, just as we did for the placeholder image in step 2.
### Defining a `SlideshowButton`
Add the following code to the call to the `live_design` macro in `app.rs`:
```
    SlideshowButton = <Button> {
        width: 50,
        height: Fill,
        grab_key_focus: false,
        draw_bg: {
            color: #fff0,
            color_down: #fff2,
        }
        icon_walk: { width: 9 },
        text: ""
    }
```

This code defines a `SlideshowButton`. A `SlideshowButton` is a tall, narrow strip that takes up the height of its container and contains a single arrow icon. We'll use two `SlideshowButton`s to navigate the slideshow by mouse.

This `SlideshowButton` has the following properties:
- `width: 50` and `height: Fill` ensure the button has the desired size.
- `draw_bg { ... }` controls how to button's background is drawn.
	- `color: #fff0` makes the button fully invisible by default.
	- `color_down: #fff2` makes the button slightly more visible when it is pressed.
- `icon_walk { ... }` controls how to button's icon is drawn.
	- `width: 9` makes the icon 9 pixels wide.
- `text: ""` disables the label for this button.
#### A Primer on Inheritance
This would be a good time to talk a bit about how inheritance works in Makepad.

Inheritance in Makepad works very similar to prototypal inheritance in languages such as JavaScript:
- The syntax `{ ... }` is used to define an object. An object is simply a collection of properties, each of which has a name and a value.
- The syntax `Object = { ... }` is used to assign a name to an object.
- Top-level named objects can be used as base classes for other objects.
- The syntax `<Base> { ... }` is used to define an object that inherits from an object `Base`.
- When an object inherits from another object, it copies over all properties from that object.
- Objects can override existing properties to change their values.
- Objects can also add new properties that weren't present in the original.

An example of this is is the `SlideshowButton` we just defined. The definition of `SlideshowButton` looks like this:
```
    SlideshowButton = <Button> {
        ...
    }
```

That means `SlideshowButton` derives from `Button`. Recall that Button is one of the built-in widgets we imported with `use link::widgets::*;`. `SlideshowButton` copies over all properties from `Button`, and then overrides several of its properties.

You may have noticed that we did not specify an image for the icon in our definition of `SlideshowButton`. That is because `SlideshowButton` is *itself* intended to be used as a base class: each time we create an instance of it, we'll specify an image for the icon of that specific instance. You'll see an example of this in `SlideshowOverlay`, just below.
### Defining a `SlideshowOverlay`
Add the following code to the call to the `live_design` macro in `app.rs`:
```
    SlideshowOverlay = <View> {
        height: Fill,
        width: Fill,
        cursor: Arrow,
        capture_overload: true,

        left = <SlideshowButton> {
            draw_icon: { svg_file: (LEFT_ARROW) }
        }
        <Filler> {}
        right = <SlideshowButton> {
            draw_icon: { svg_file: (RIGHT_ARROW) }
        }
    }
```

This code defines a `SlideshowOverlay`. A `SlideshowOverlay` is a transparent container that sits on top of an `Image`, and contains the two `SlideshowButton`s we'll use for navigating the slideshow by mouse.

This `SlideshowOverlay` has the following properties:
- `height: Fill` and `width: Fill` ensure the overlay stretches to fill its container.
- `cursor: Arrow` sets the icon of the mouse cursor to an arrow when it hovers over the overlay.
- `capture_overload: true` enables the overlay to capture events that have already been captured by one of its children.

Each `SlideshowOverlay` contains two `SlideshowButton`s, with a `Filler` in between:
```
        left = <SlideshowButton> {
            draw_icon: { svg_file: (LEFT_ARROW) }
        }
        <Filler> {}
        right = <SlideshowButton> {
            draw_icon: { svg_file: (RIGHT_ARROW) }
        }
```

For each `SlideshowButton`, we override the `svg_file` property of `draw_icon` with the variables for the arrow icons we defined earlier.

`Filler` is a helper widget that fills up any unused space in a container. This ensures that the first `SlideshowButton` is laid out on the left while the second is laid out on the right.
### Handling Key Focus
TODO
### Defining a `Slideshow`
Add the following code to the call to the `live_design` macro in `app.rs`:
```
    Slideshow = <View> {
        flow: Overlay,

        image = <Image> {
            width: Fill,
            height: Fill,
            fit: Biggest,
            source: (PLACEHOLDER)
        }
        overlay = <SlideshowOverlay> {}
    }
```

This code defines a `Slideshow`. A `Slideshow` combines an `Image` with the `SlideshowOverlay` we created earlier.

This `Slideshow` has the following properties:
- `flow: Overlay` ensures the slideshow's children are stacked on top of each other.
### Updating `App`
Replace the definition of `App` in the call to the `live_design` macro in `app.rs` with the one here below:
```
    App = {{App}} {
        ui: <Root> {
            <Window> {
                body = <View> {
                    // <ImageGrid> {}
                    slideshow = <Slideshow> {}
                }
            }
        }
    }
```

We've simply commented out our `ImageGrid`, and replaced it with our `Slideshow`. This is just a temporary measure so that we can develop our slideshow without worrying about the image grid. In the next step, we'll make it so we can switch between the image grid and the slideshow at will. 
## Extending the State
Now that we've updated the DSL code with the definitions we need, it's time to extend the state for our app with some additional fields and methods we need to make the slideshow dynamic.

Specifically, weâ€™ll add a field to track which image is currently displayed in the slideshow, and a few helper methods for updating that state at runtime.
### Updating the `State` struct
Replace the definition of the `State` struct and its corresponding implementation of the `Default` trait with the one here below:
```

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct State {
    image_paths: Vec<PathBuf>,
    images_per_row: usize,
    current_image_idx: Option<usize>,
}

impl Default for State {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            image_paths: Vec::new(),
            images_per_row: 4,
            current_image_idx: None,
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, we've added one additional field to the `State` struct:
- `current_image_idx` contains the index of the image that is currently displayed in the slideshow.

Note that `current_image_idx` is actually an `Option<usize>`. This is to handle the case when there are no images to display:
- If `current_image_idx` is `Some(image_idx)`, the slideshow should display the image with the given index.
- If `current_image_idx` is `None`, the slideshow should display the placeholder image instead.
### Adding Helper Methods
TODO

The `set_current_image` method is used to change which image is currently displayed in the slideshow:
```
impl App {
    pub fn set_current_image(&mut self, cx: &mut Cx, image_idx: Option<usize>) {
        self.state.current_image_idx = image_idx;
        let image = self.ui.image(id!(slideshow.image));
        if let Some(image_idx) = self.state.current_image_idx {
            let image_path = &self.state.image_paths[image_idx];
            image.load_image_file_by_path(cx, &image_path).unwrap();
        } else {
            image
                .load_image_dep_by_path(
                    cx,
                    "crate://self/resources/placeholder_image.jpg",
                )
                .unwrap();
        }
        self.ui.view(id!(slideshow)).redraw(cx);
    }
}
```

Here's what this method does:
- It sets `current_image_idx` to the new value.
- It gets a reference to the `Image` inside the `Slideshow`.
- If current_image_idx is Some(image_idx):
	- Load the 
It updates current_image_idx to the new value.
It obtains the <Image> inside the SlideShow.
If current_image_index is Some(image_idx):
Use image_idx to retrieve the corresponding path.
Load the image with this path.
Otherwise:
Load the image with the placeholder image.
Finally, it calls .redraw(cx) on the slideshow. This triggers the slideshow to be redrawn with the new image.


```
impl App {
.   pub fn navigate_left(&mut self, cx: &mut Cx) {
        if let Some(image_idx) = self.state.current_image_idx {
            if image_idx > 0 {
                self.set_current_image(cx, Some(image_idx - 1));
            }
        }
    }

    pub fn navigate_right(&mut self, cx: &mut Cx) {
        if let Some(image_idx) = self.state.current_image_idx {
            if image_idx + 1 < self.state.image_paths.len() {
                self.set_current_image(cx, Some(image_idx + 1));
            }
        }
    }
}
```
