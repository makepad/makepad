## [0.13.1] - 2021-10-27
### Fixed
- `Face::line_gap` logic.

## [0.13.0] - 2021-10-24
### Added
- Complete GSUB and GPOS tables support. Available under the `opentype-layout` feature.
- Public access to all supported TrueType tables. This allows a low-level, but still safe,
  access to internal data layout, which can be used for performance optimization, like caching.
- `Style` enum and `Face::style` method.
- `Face::glyph_name` can be disabled via the `glyph-names` feature to reduce binary size.

### Changed
- Improved ascender/descender/line_gap resolving logic.
- `Face` methods: `has_glyph_classes`, `glyph_class`, `glyph_mark_attachment_class`,
  `is_mark_glyph` and `glyph_variation_delta` are moved to `gdef::Table`.
- The `Names` struct is no longer an iterator, but a container.
  You have to call `into_iter()` manually.
- The `VariationAxes` struct is no longer an iterator, but a container.
  You have to call `into_iter()` manually.
- Most of the `Name` struct methods become public fields.
- `Face::units_per_em` no longer returns `Option`.
- (`cmap`) Improved subtable 12 performance. Thanks to [xnuk](https://github.com/xnuk)

### Removed
- (c-api) `ttfp_glyph_class`, `ttfp_get_glyph_class`, `ttfp_get_glyph_mark_attachment_class`,
  `ttfp_is_mark_glyph`, `ttfp_glyph_variation_delta` and `ttfp_has_table`.
- `TableName` enum and `Face::has_table`. Tables can be access directly now.
- `Face::character_mapping_subtables`. Use `Face::tables().cmap` instead.
- `Face::kerning_subtables`. Use `Face::tables().kern` instead.

### Fixed
- `Iterator::count` implementation for `cmap::Subtables`, `name::Names` and `LazyArrayIter32`.

## [0.12.3] - 2021-06-27
### Changed
- (`glyf`) Always use a calculated bbox.

## [0.12.2] - 2021-06-11
### Fixed
- `Face::glyph_bounding_box` for variable `glyf`.
- (`glyf`) Do not skip glyphs with zero-sized bbox.

## [0.12.1] - 2021-05-24
### Added

  Thanks to [csmulhern](https://github.com/csmulhern)
- Derive more traits by default. Thanks to [dhardy](https://github.com/dhardy)

## [0.12.0] - 2021-02-14
### Changed
- `Face::ascender` and `Face::descender` will use
  [usWinAscent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#uswinascent) and
  [usWinDescent](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#uswindescent)
  when `USE_TYPO_METRICS` flag is not set in `OS/2` table.
  Previously, those values were ignored and
  [hhea::ascender](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/hhea#ascender) and
  [hhea::descender](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/hhea#descender)
  were used. Now `hhea` table values will be used only when `OS/2` table is not present.
- `Face::outline_glyph` and `Face::glyph_bounding_box` in case of a `glyf` table
  can fallback to a calculated bbox when the embedded bbox is malformed now.

## [0.11.0] - 2021-02-04
### Added
- `FaceTables`, which allowed to load `Face` not only from a single chunk of data,
  but also in a per-table way. Which is useful for WOFF parsing.
  No changes to the API.
  Thanks to [fschutt](https://github.com/fschutt)

## [0.10.1] - 2021-01-21
### Changed
- Update a font used for tests.

## [0.10.0] - 2021-01-16
### Added

  By disabling it you can reduce `ttf-parser` binary size overhead almost twice.

### Changed
- (`gvar`) Increase the maximum number of variation tuples from 16 to 32.
  Increases stack usage and makes `gvar` parsing 10% slower now.

### Fixed
- (`CFF`) Fix `seac` processing. Thanks to [wezm](https://github.com/wezm)

## [0.9.0] - 2020-12-05

  Mainly because it's useless without a proper shaping.

## [0.8.3] - 2020-11-15
### Added
- `Face::glyph_variation_delta`

### Fixed
- `Iterator::nth` implementation for `cmap::Subtables` and `Names`.

- `Face::typographic_ascender`
- `Face::typographic_descender`
- `Face::typographic_line_gap`
- `Face::capital_height`

## [0.8.0] - 2020-07-21
### Added

- `Face::character_mapping_subtables`

### Changed
- (CFF,CFF2) 10% faster parsing.
- `Face::from_slice` returns `Result` now.
- `Name::platform_id` returns `PlatformId` instead of `Option<PlatformId>` now.
- The `cmap` module became public.

### Fixed
- `Face::width` parsing.
- Possible u32 overflow on 32-bit platforms during `Face::from_slice`.
- (cmap) `Face::glyph_variation_index` processing when the encoding table has only one glyph.

## [0.7.0] - 2020-07-16
### Added
- (CFF) CID fonts support.
- (CFF) `seac` support.
- `Font::global_bounding_box`

### Changed
- Rename `Font` to `Face`, because this is what it actually is.
- Rename `Font::from_data` to `Font::from_slice` to match serde and other libraries.
- Rename `Name::name_utf8` to `Name::to_string`.

### Removed
- `Font::family_name` and `Font::post_script_name`. They were a bit confusing.
  Prefer:
  ```
  face.names().find(|name| name.name_id() == name_id::FULL_NAME).and_then(|name| name.to_string())
  ```

## [0.6.2] - 2020-07-02
### Added
- `Name::is_unicode`
- `Font::family_name` will load names with Windows Symbol encoding now.

- `Font::glyph_raster_image` and `Font::glyph_svg_image`.
- `Font::kerning_subtables` with subtable formats 0..3 support.

### Changed
- (c-api) The library doesn't allocate `ttfp_font` anymore. All allocations should be
  handled by the caller from now.

### Removed
- `Font::glyphs_kerning`. Use `Font::kerning_subtables` instead.
- (c-api) `ttfp_create_font` and `ttfp_destroy_font`.
  Use `ttfp_font_size_of` + `ttfp_font_init` instead.
  ```c
  ttfp_font *font = (ttfp_font*)alloca(ttfp_font_size_of());
  ttfp_font_init(font_data, font_data_size, 0, font);
  ```
- Logging support. We haven't used it anyway.

### Fixed
- (`gvar`) Integer overflow.
- (`cmap`) Integer overflow during subtable format 2 parsing.
- (`CFF`, `CFF2`) DICT number parsing.
- `Font::glyph_*_advance` will return `None` when glyph ID
  is larger than the number of metrics in the table.
- Ignore variation offset in `Font::glyph_*_advance` and `Font::glyph_*_side_bearing`
  when `HVAR`/`VVAR` tables are missing.
  Previously returned `None` which is incorrect.

  flag in OS/2 table now.
- `glyph_hor_metrics` was split into `glyph_hor_advance` and `glyph_hor_side_bearing`.
