## How to sync with upstream

The port is a mechanical 1:1 translation: **one Rust module per C file**, same
function names (`b3` prefix stripped, snake_case), same struct fields
(snake_case), same algorithm structure and float operation order. See
`PORTING.md` for the full conventions table (ids, `Vec` for `b3Array`,
`Arc<T>` for user-owned geometry, closures for callback+context pairs, etc.).

To pull in upstream changes:

1. `cd box3d && git fetch && git log 29bf523ce..origin/main -- src/ include/`
2. For each changed C file, diff it and apply the same change to the
   same-named module in `libs/box3d/src/`. The function order inside each
   module follows the C file, so hunks usually land in the same place.
3. If a test changed, mirror it in `libs/box3d/tests/` (same file names).
4. `cargo test -p makepad-box3d` must stay green (147 tests as of the initial
   port).
5. Update the commit hash in this README.

### Where things live

- `include/box3d/*.h` types → `src/types.rs`, `src/id.rs`, `src/constants.rs`,
  `src/math_functions.rs` (public math + math_functions.c)
- `src/<file>.c` → `src/<file>.rs` (including all 8 joint files, solver,
  contact_solver, physics_world, etc.)
- `src/math_internal.h` → `src/math_internal.rs`; `src/core.h/.c` →
  `src/core.rs`; `src/simd.h/.c` → `src/simd.rs` (scalar path)
- `shared/utils.h` (test RNG) → `src/test_utils.rs`
- `test/test_<x>.c` → `tests/test_<x>.rs` (`ENSURE` → `ensure!`,
  `ENSURE_SMALL` → `ensure_small!`, exported from the crate root)

## Intentional differences from C (keep these in mind when diffing)

**Not ported** (skip these when syncing, or port them then):
- Recording/replay (`recording.c`, `recording_replay.c`, `recording_ops.inl`)
  and `world_snapshot.c`
- Debug draw (`b3World_Draw`, `b3DebugDraw`, draw fns in joints/shapes) and
  dump/save/load debug helpers (`b3Dump*`, `b3DynamicTree_Save/Load`)
- Compound byte serialization (`b3ConvertCompoundToBytes`/`BytesToCompound`)
- `BOX3D_DOUBLE_PRECISION` (large world mode): `Pos = Vec3`,
  `WorldTransform = Transform` type aliases; the double-precision test halves
  are not ported
- SSE2/NEON: only the `B3_SIMD_NONE` scalar path is ported (`simd.rs`, and the
  4-wide scalar-emulated contact solver in `contact_solver.rs`)
- Threading: everything runs serially (worker count 1). The C task/stage
  atomics collapsed to in-order execution with identical iteration order; the
  stage/block structure is preserved so the C control flow still maps
- The global world registry: `World` is an owned struct, every API function
  takes `world` explicitly (`b3Body_GetPosition(id)` →
  `body_get_position(&world, id)`)

**Representation changes:**
- `b3Array(T)` → `Vec<T>`; the arena/block allocators are bookkeeping shims
  (`arena_allocator.rs`), call sites use plain `Vec`s
- Blob geometry (hull/mesh/height field/compound trailing arrays + byte
  offsets) → plain `Vec` fields; `version`/`byteCount` fields don't exist, so
  tests asserting them skip those lines
- User-owned `const b3HullData*` etc. → `Arc<HullData>`; `b3DestroyHull` is
  Arc drop. The world hull database keeps C's explicit per-shape refcount
- C unions → both-fields structs (`ContactCache`, contact convex/mesh) or
  enums (`ShapeGeometry`, `JointUnion`, `ChildShapeGeom`)
- Solver pointers → indices: per-color constraint pointers became
  (start, count) ranges into StepContext-owned arrays; see the layout contract
  at the top of `contact_solver.rs` and the StepContext redesign note at the
  top of `solver.rs` (awake-set states/sims are `mem::take`n into the context
  during solve — any new C code that reads body data through the world during
  the solve stages needs the `Option<&StepContext>` dual-path pattern, see
  `joint.rs::reaction_body_transform`)

**Numerical/determinism notes:**
- The port preserves float operation order, and the deterministic
  `b3Atan2`/`b3ComputeCosSin` are digit-for-digit. The simulation is
  self-deterministic (the determinism test runs the ragdoll scenario twice and
  compares hashes; sleep step 269 matches the C float build exactly), but it
  is NOT bit-identical to C builds: `remainderf` is implemented via f64
  (`math_functions.rs::remainder_f32`), and geometry content hashes are
  computed over a canonical little-endian serialization instead of raw struct
  bytes, so hash VALUES differ from C
- `qsort.h` call sites use `sort_unstable_by`; ordering of exactly-equal keys
  may differ from C (self-consistent)
- Upstream quirks preserved on purpose (flagged with comments, don't "fix"
  when syncing): the scalar `scatter_bodies` does not apply per-axis lock
  flags (matches C's `B3_SIMD_NONE` path; C's SSE2/NEON path does),
  `get_wheel_joint_force` sums `lowerSuspensionLimit` instead of
  `lowerSuspensionImpulse`, spine_02 inherits spine_01's name in the human
  scenario

**Test suite:** `cargo test -p makepad-box3d` (147 tests). `test_recording.c`
is not ported (recording skipped). `test_determinism.rs` asserts run-to-run
equality instead of the C `EXPECTED_HASH` constant. `tests/test_smoke.rs` is
port-specific (not from C).
