#!/bin/bash
# usage: run.sh <makepad binary>: `makepad test --allow-c pc-app`: the test starts the package's
# binary with its own environment and with a cleared one, and the binary starts itself with a
# cleared one; each run is the test's build (its build scripts' input only in the test's
# environment, the cargo `[env]` of the workspace as the test's build applied it, its native
# package as the test's run built it) and the program has the environment it was given (relax
# issue 168). Then what hands a run that over grants nothing: a run of pc-app without
# `--allow-c` named the test's native build (RELAX_RUN_NATIVE), or handed a build environment
# that says RELAX_ALLOW_C=1 (RELAX_BUILD_ENV), loads no native library; with `--allow-c`, a native
# build named outside the run dir is not taken, said in one line. One line per case; the last
# is "prepared_child: ok" or "prepared_child: FAILED" (exit 1). And a run's program that a shell
# execs again (its own executable, from a shell it starts with a cleared environment or another
# build input) is that run's build too (relax issue 172, PR 175's shell case).
