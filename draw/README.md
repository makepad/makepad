# makepad-draw-2d

This is a lower-level crate for Makepad Framework. For an explanation of what Makepad Framework is, please see the README for the [makepad-widgets](https://crates.io/crates/makepad-widgets) crate.

This crate contains all code related to drawing applications. In particular, it contains the code for the Box API, which is what we use to layout widgets, the font stack, and a collection of base shaders that can be customized to draw almost anything we need.

This crate is re-exported by the [makepad-widgets](https://crates.io/crates/makepad-widgets) crate. In a typical application, you would depend on that crate instead of this one.
